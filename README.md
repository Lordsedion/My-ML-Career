# My-ML-Career
A list of projects I will take on to go from an average ML engineer to an AI expert.
In no particular order, all this concepts will be learnt, mastered and the corresponding Github Repositories will be attached to each of the projects.

1: Tensor manipulations in Tensorflow and PyTorch.

2: Advanced Understanding and Implementation of ML evaluation metrics.

3: Implementation of a Basic Neural Network.

4: Implementation of a Basic Convolutional Neural Network.

4: Implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network.

5: Implementation of Attention Mechanisms.

6: Word Embeddings.

7: Implementation of Transformer Network for NLP.

8: Implementation of Vision Transformer.

9: Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks for Image.

10: Adding RLHF to a custom trained micro-llm to fine-tune it to respond to human questions.
