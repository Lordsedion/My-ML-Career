# My-ML-Career
A list of projects I will take on to go from an average ML engineer to an AI expert.
In no particular order, all these concepts will be learned, and mastered and the corresponding GitHub Repositories will be attached to each of the projects.

1: Tensor manipulations in Tensorflow and PyTorch.

2: Advanced Understanding and Implementation of ML evaluation metrics.

3: Implementation of a Basic Neural Network.

4: Implementation of a Basic Convolutional Neural Network.

4: Implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network.

5: Implementation of Attention Mechanisms.

6: Word Embeddings.

7: Implementation of Transformer Network for NLP.

8: Implementation of Vision Transformer.

9: Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks for Image.

10: Adding RLHF to a custom-trained micro-LLM to fine-tune it to respond to human questions.

### And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
